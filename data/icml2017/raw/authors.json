    "bio": "Raia Hadsell, a senior research scientist at DeepMind, has worked on deep learning and robotics problems for over 10 years. Her early research developed the notion of manifold learning using Siamese networks, which has been used extensively for invariant feature learning. After completing a PhD with Yann LeCun, which featured a self-supervised deep learning vision system for a mobile robot, her research continued at Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute and SRI International, and in early 2014 she joined DeepMind in London to study artificial general intelligence. Her current research focuses on the challenge of continual learning for AI agents and robotic systems. While deep RL algorithms are capable of attaining superhuman performance on single tasks, they cannot transfer that performance to additional tasks, especially if experienced sequentially. She has proposed neural approaches such as policy distillation, progressive nets, and elastic weight consolidation to solve the problem of catastrophic forgetting and improve transfer learning."

    "bio": "Michal is a junior scientist in SequeL team at Inria Lille - Nord Europe, France, lead by Philippe Preux and Rémi Munos. He also teaches the course Graphs in Machine Learning at l'ENS Cachan. Michal is primarily interested in designing algorithms that would require as little human supervision as possible. This means 1) reducing the “intelligence” that humans need to input into the system and 2) minimising the data that humans need spend inspecting, classifying, or “tuning” the algorithms. Another important feature of machine learning algorithms should be the ability to adapt to changing environments. That is why he is working in domains that are able to deal with minimal feedback, such as bandit algorithms, semi-supervised learning, and anomaly detection. Most recently he has worked on sequential algorithms with structured decisions where exploiting the structure can lead to provably faster learning. In the past the common thread of Michal's work has been adaptive graph-based learning and its application to the real world applications such as recommender systems, medical error detection, and face recognition. His industrial collaborators include Adobe, Intel, Technicolor, and Microsoft Research. He received his PhD in 2011 from University of Pittsburgh under the supervision of Miloš Hauskrecht and after was a postdoc of Rémi Munos."

Koyejo's research interests are in the development and analysis of probabilistic and statistical machine learning techniques motivated by, and applied to various modern big data problems. He is particularly interested in the analysis of large scale neuroimaging data.\n\nKoyejo completed his Ph.D in Electrical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin advised by Joydeep Ghosh, and completed postdoctoral research at Stanford University with a focus on developing Machine learning techniques for neuroimaging data. His postdoctoral research was primarily with Russell A. Poldrack and Pradeep Ravikumar. Koyejo has been the recipient of several awards including the outstanding NCE/ECE student award, a best student paper award from the conference on uncertainty in artificial intelligence (UAI) and a trainee award from the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM)."

He is a joint leader of the Computer Vision group in NICTA, a government funded research laboratory.\nDr. Hartley worked at the General Electric Research and Development Center from 1985 to 2001, working first in VLSI design, and later in computer vision.  He became involved with Image Understanding and Scene Reconstruction working with GE's Simulation and Control Systems Division. \nIn 1991, he began an extended research effort in the area of applying projective geometry techniques to reconstruction using calibrated and semi-calibrated cameras. This research direction was one of the dominant themes in computer vision research throughout the 1990s. In 2000, he co-authored (with Andrew Zisserman) a book on Multiview Geometry in Computer Vision, summarizing the previous decade’s research in this area."

He received an M.A. in engineering from Cambridge University in 1989 and his Ph.D. from University College London (UCL) in 1993. His awards include: Royal Society University Research Fellow, Texas Instruments Distinguished Visiting Professor at Rice University, European Research Council Advanced Grant, IEEE Fellow, EURASIP Fellow and a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award. Currently he also leads the University Defence Research Collaboration (UDRC), a U.K. programme of signal processing research in defence in collaboration with the U.K. Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL).\n\nHis research has focused on nonlinear time series, source separation, sparse representations and compressed sensing. He has made key contributions to these fields including: the development of signal embedding theorems for nonlinear dynamical time series and the development of new theoretical and algorithmic results in Independent Component Analysis.  \n\nMost recently he has pioneered the use of sparse representations as a fundamental tool in signal processing, source separation and compressed sensing. This work\nincludes: the proposal and analysis of the highly popular Iterative Hard Thresholding algorithm for sparse reconstruction; the development of a theory for the sampling of structured sparse signal models as well as the development of a variety of new practical sampling and reconstruction techniques that exploit structured sparsity. He has also explored the application of these ideas to advanced medical imaging and RF based sensing and machine learning."

He joined the Sony Computer Science Laboratory in 1997 and created the music team to conduct research on interactive music listening, composition and performance. Since its creation, the team developed several award winning technologies (constraint-based spatialisation, intelligent music scheduling using metadata) and systems: MusicSpace, PathBuilder, Continuator for interactive music improvisation, Flow Composer, etc.).\nFrançois Pachet has published extensively in artificial intelligence and computer music.He has been elected ECCAI Fellow in 2014. His current goal, funded by an ERC Advanced Grant, is to build a new generation of tools to assist music creation. He is also an accomplished musician (guitar, composition) and has published two music albums (in jazz and pop) as composer and performer."
