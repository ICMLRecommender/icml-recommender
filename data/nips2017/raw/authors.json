    "bio": "I’m a research scientist working on Magenta, an effort to generate music, video, images and text using machine intelligence. Magenta is part of the Google Brain team and is using TensorFlow (www.tensorflow.org), an open-source library for machine learning. The question Magenta asks is, “Can machines make music and art? If so, how? If not, why not?” The goal if Magenta is to produce open-source tools and models that help creative people be even more creative. I’m primarily looking at how to use so-called “generative” machine learning models to create engaging media. Additionally, I’m working on how to bring other aspects of the creative process into play. For example, art and music is not just about generating new pieces. It’s also about drawing one’s attention, being surprising, telling an interesting story, knowing what’s interesting in a scene, and so on.\nBefore starting the Magenta project, I worked on music search and recommendation for Google Play Music. My research goal in this area was to use machine learning and audio signal processing to help listeners find the music they want when they want it. This involves both learning from audio and learning from how users consume music. In the audio domain, the main goal is to transform the ones and zeros in a digital audio file into something where musically-similar songs are also numerically similar, making it easier to do music recommendation. This is (a) user-dependent: my idea of similar is not the same as yours and (b) changes with context: my idea of similarity changes when I make a playlist for jogging versus making a playlist for a dinner party. I might choose the same song (say \"Taxman\" by the Beatles) but perhaps it would be the tempo for jogging that drove the selection of that specific song versus \"I like the album Revolver and want to add it to the dinner party mix\" for a dinner party playlist.\n\nI joined Google in 2003. Before then, I was an Associate Professor in Computer Science at University of Montreal. I helped found the BRAMS research center (Brain Music and Sound; www.brams.org) and was involved at the McGill CIRMMT center (Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology; www.cirmmt.org). Aside from audio signal processing and machine learning, I worked on music performance modeling. What exactly does a good music performer add to what is already in the score? I treated this as a machine learning question: Hypothetically, if we showed a piano-playing robot a huge collection of Chopin performances--- from the best in the world all the way down to that of a struggling teenage pianist---could it learn to play well by analyzing all of these examples? If so, what’s the right way to perform that analysis? In the end I learned a lot about the complexity and beauty of human music performance, and how performance relates to and extends composition."

His research focuses on energy-efficient deep learning, at the intersection between machine learning and computer architecture. He proposed Deep Compression that can compress deep neural networks by an order of magnitude without losing the prediction accuracy. He designed EIE: Efficient Inference Engine, a hardware architecture that can perform inference directly on the compressed sparse model, which saves memory bandwidth and results in significant speedup and energy saving. His work has been featured by TheNextPlatform, TechEmergence, Embedded Vision and O’Reilly. He led research efforts in model compression and hardware acceleration for deep learning that won the Best Paper Award at ICLR’16 and the Best Paper Award at FPGA’17."

He studies learning and\ninference in humans and machines, with the twin goals of understanding\nhuman intelligence in computational terms and bringing computers\ncloser to human capacities.  He focuses on problems of inductive\ngeneralization from limited data -- learning concepts and word\nmeanings, inferring causal relations or goals -- and learning abstract\nknowledge that supports these inductive leaps in the form of\nprobabilistic generative models or 'intuitive theories'.  He has also\ndeveloped several novel machine learning methods inspired by human\nlearning and perception, most notably Isomap, an approach to\nunsupervised learning of nonlinear manifolds in high-dimensional data.\nHe has been Associate Editor for the journal Cognitive Science, has\nbeen active on program committees for the CogSci and NIPS conferences,\nand has co-organized a number of workshops, tutorials and summer\nschools in human and machine learning.  Several of his papers have\nreceived outstanding paper awards or best student paper awards at the\nIEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), NIPS, and\nCognitive Science conferences.  He is the recipient of the New\nInvestigator Award from the Society for Mathematical Psychology\n(2005), the Early Investigator Award from the Society of Experimental\nPsychologists (2007), and the Distinguished Scientific Award for Early\nCareer Contribution to Psychology (in the area of cognition and human\nlearning) from the American Psychological Association (2008)."

After ten years as a supervisor and art director in the film industry he decided to plunge back into graduate school and obtained a PhD in Physics from Caltech in 2014.  His work focused on computational chemistry approaches in finding novel photovoltaic materials.  During this time he worked closely with multiple research groups both at Caltech and Fortune 500 companies.  Deciding to leave academia, upon graduation he joined a management-consulting firm where he headed the analytics department and managed engagements onsite.  He joined Cognescent recently to work on cutting-edge brain-machine interfaces."

I got my Bachelor in Mechatronic (Robotics) Engineering, and Ph.D. in Engineering (Probabilistic Graphical Models and Computational Statistics, supervisor Professor Fabio G. Cozman) from University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. I received my training in MRI in the Department of Radiology at University of Pennsylvania, as Biomedical Postdoctoral Researcher (2007-2008), and worked with Bayesian methods applied to neuroimaging. Continuing the training in fMRI, I was Postdoctoral Associate at Yale University (2008-2010), under supervision of Prof. Li in exciting projects including investigations of functional connectivity (Granger causality, regression models, Bayesian networks) of brain areas involved in cognitive control. Broadly, I am interested in addiction and cognitive control research, with particular focus on the application of machine learning and pattern recognition techniques and theoretical modeling of decision-making, as well as predictive modeling."

His main application domain is energy and power systems, and earlier Roel also worked on problems in systems biology. Lastly, given his application-driven research agenda, Roel is interested in incorporating non-functional requirements into the design of systems, such as privacy, fairness or justice considerations."

    "bio": "Tommaso Fellin graduated in Physics at the University of Padova in 1998 studying enzyme kinetics with time-resolved spectroscopy. From 1998 to 2003, as a PhD student in the Dept. of Biomedical Sciences at University of Padova, he investigated the biophysical properties of voltage-gated calcium channels and the functional consequences of mutations in calcium channels linked to human neurological disorders. During his first postdoctoral training period (2003-2004), he integrated electrophysiological and imaging techniques to study neuron-glia communication in brain slices. In 2005 he moved to the Dept. of Neuroscience at University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine as a senior post doctoral researcher and continued his research on neuron-glia interaction. In 2008, he joined the department of Neuroscience and Brain Technologies at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) as a junior team leader. He is currently senior team leader with tenure at the IIT, head of the Optical Approaches to Brain Function Laboratory, and co-head (together with Dr. S. Panzeri) of the Neural Coding Laboratory. He is also recipient of the European Research Council (ERC) consolidator grant NEURO-PATTERNS and co-funder of the start-up SmartMicroOptics. His research activity focuses on the study of cortical microcircuits and on the development of innovative methods to probe their function."

    "bio": "Michal is a junior scientist in SequeL team at Inria Lille - Nord Europe, France, lead by Philippe Preux and Rémi Munos. He also teaches the course Graphs in Machine Learning at l'ENS Cachan. Michal is primarily interested in designing algorithms that would require as little human supervision as possible. This means 1) reducing the “intelligence” that humans need to input into the system and 2) minimising the data that humans need spend inspecting, classifying, or “tuning” the algorithms. Another important feature of machine learning algorithms should be the ability to adapt to changing environments. That is why he is working in domains that are able to deal with minimal feedback, such as semi-supervised learning, bandit algorithms, and anomaly detection. The common thread of Michal's work has been adaptive graph-based learning and its application to the real world applications such as recommender systems, medical error detection, and face recognition. His industrial collaborators include Intel, Technicolor, and Microsoft Research. He received his PhD in 2011 from University of Pittsburgh under the supervision of Miloš Hauskrecht and after was a postdoc of Rémi Munos."

He is an honorary member of the Neuroscience Research Program, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Founding Fellow of AAAI and a founding member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research. Among other honors he received the Laurea Honoris Causa from the University of Pavia for the Volta Bicentennial, the 2003 Gabor Award, the Okawa Prize 2009, the AAAS Fellowship and the 2014 Swartz Prize for Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience. He is one of the most cited computational scientists with contributions ranging from the biophysical and behavioral studies of the visual system to the computational analyses of vision and learning in humans and machines. With W. Reichardt he characterized quantitatively the visuo-motor control system in the fly. With D. Marr, he introduced the seminal idea of levels of analysis in computational neuroscience. He introduced regularization as a mathematical framework to approach the ill-posed problems of vision and the key problem of learning from data. In the last decade he has developed an influential hierarchical model of visual recognition in the visual cortex. The citation for the recent 2009 Okawa prize mentions his ââ¦outstanding contributions to the establishment of computational neuroscience, and pioneering researches ranging from the biophysical and behavioral studies of the visual system to the computational analysis of vision and learning in humans and machines.â \n\nHis research has always been interdisciplinary, between brains and computers. It is now focused on the mathematics of learning theory, the applications of learning techniques to computer vision and especially on computational neuroscience of the visual cortex. A former Corporate Fellow of Thinking Machines Corporation and a former director of PHZ Capital Partners, Inc., he is a director of Mobileye and was involved in starting, or investing in, several other high tech companies including Arris Pharmaceutical, nFX, Imagen, Digital Persona and Deep Mind."

Madalina has obtained a PhD in Machine Learning from Carnegie Mellon University in September 2015, advised by Professor Artur Dubrawski. The focus of her PhD thesis, entitled “Discovering Compact and Informative Structures through Data Partitioning”, is learning interpretable ensembles, with applicability ranging from image classification to a clinical alert prediction system. Madalina is currently expanding her research on interpretable models, in part by applying deep learning to obtain salient representations from biomedical “deep” data, including time series, text and images. Madalina is the recipient of the GE Foundation Scholar Leader Award for Central and Eastern Europe. She is the recipient of the Marr Prize for Best Paper at ICCV 2015 and of Star Research Award at the Annual Congress of the Society of Critical Care Medicine 2016. She has organized two editions of the Machine Learning for Clinical Data Analysis Workshop at NIPS, in 2013 and 2014."
